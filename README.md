# Dev-Site 
This is my personal website: [www.markschumaker.dev](https://www.markschumaker.dev).

## Tech
It's built with vanilla JS and is deployed on Netlify. I really like writing with vanilla JavaScript and wanted to make it as simple as possible. 

## Posts 
It also includes a really simple blog where I write about software. The posts are stored on another repo [`writing-on-software`](https://github.com/MarkSchu/writing-on-software).
